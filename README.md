# Global-Workforce-Pulse-A-Deep-Dive-into-HR-Analytics
HR Analysis
🚀 Just wrapped up one of the most insightful data analytics projects I’ve worked on so far!

🔍 Project Title: Global Workforce Pulse – HR Analytics Dashboard
In this project, I explored a large-scale HR dataset to uncover key trends and patterns around employee attrition, satisfaction, training efficiency, gender diversity, and performance across global departments.

🛠 Tools used:

Excel (Data cleaning + calculated columns)

Power BI (Dashboard building, DAX measures, storytelling, design)

SQL (Data modeling + query planning)

📊 The dashboard features:

Multi-page analysis covering attrition, satisfaction, performance, training, and demographic distribution.

Advanced conditional formatting, custom theming, and consistent narrative storytelling.

Actionable insights translated into clear recommendations for decision-makers.

This wasn’t just a project — it was a deep dive into turning raw HR data into strategic business insight.

💬 Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Let’s connect if you're passionate about data and storytelling!
